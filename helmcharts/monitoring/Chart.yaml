## A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
##
## Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
## to be deployed.
##
## Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
## a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
## pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

## This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
## to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
## Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org)
